# Star Trakker

_Search nodes, the final frontier_

## Captain‚Äôs log (Stardate 74328.9):

I have built a **Star Trakker** app that solves all the following challenges:

- Build lists and display selected content from a data tree structure
- Search and highlight content while preventing xss vulnerabilities
- replace content with template string variables

In addition, I styled the app with an outerspace like theme and included ‚Äúuniversalization‚Äù for various species to enjoy

## The Process

With the limited amount of time I had between job searching and other activities, I‚Äôm pleased with the outcome. I quickly made sure the application worked in a few component files, coding most of the logic within the components themselves (api calls, useState, useEffect, prop drilling). Well aware to later optimize and refactor.

Next I styled the app giving great thought to design and overall usability.

Then I decided to move most of the state logic into a redux architecture; all the while refactoring components down. As opposed to using standard react-redux, connect, mapStateToProps and such, I implemented redux utilizing [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/). Doing so proved effective as I was able to clean up the components and simplify the codebase using react-redux hooks.

I developed a crafty solution to cache and replace node states upon empty searches, therefore eliminated unnecessary api calls. Creating a unique `nodeId` (parent id‚Äôs separated by dots) became useful in selecting the correct connection within the node tree. The unique `nodeId` could also be used to recursively insert selected connections and traverse node connections inside of the `connection.js` component.

Highlighting content using a nifty regex expressions that ignores any html tags while still allowing multi-search functionality. DOMpurify library to sanitize the innerHtml was key to prevent xss attacks. Furthermore, I took the liberty of removing any empty string literals text from being displayed.

## Further implementation:

Overall the app is highly functional but could be expanded for better usability. For example, the user might want the list to stay open upon click (similar to vsCode file-folder structure). Or be able to change the variables in a dropdown UI, saving changes to the backend. The search endpoint also searches the titles, if this was a real app, I‚Äôd also highlight text in the node list. For larger datasets, I‚Äôd consider paginating the data in and better caching within global state.

Other aspects of the code would need attention too;

- internationalization
- accessibility (alternative text for images, keyboard navigation, resizing text, etc),
- typescript (opted out, but usually my go to),
- jsdoc comments everywhere (currently only in util files),
- scss mixins/variables or even better styled-components
- constants, enums

If this was a production ready app, I would eject create-react-app and tailor a production config. Though realistically would have built the webpack from scratch. Code splitting, lazy loading sections, common chunks. Dockerfiles, env variables, deploy scripts.

## Getting Started

first start server:

```
https://github.com/Tumne/Ada-fe-test.git
cd star-trakker/
yarn
yarn start-server
```

then in the client (NOTE: building may take some time):

```
cd client/
yarn
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
